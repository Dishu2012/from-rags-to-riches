# from-rags-to-riches

a song by Dishen Suthar


In a dusty alley, where dreams were scarce, Lived a man with hunger, heart, and fierce grace. His pockets empty, but his spirit unyielding, He vowed to rise above, his destiny revealing.

 With calloused hands, he toiled day and night, Chasing visions of a life bathed in golden light. From humble beginnings, he carved a path, A symphony of resilience, echoing his wrath.

 From rags to riches, he danced with fate, A phoenix rising, defying every weight. His story etched in the stars, a cosmic plan, The boy who emerged as the richest man.

 He stitched his dreams with threads of hope, Navigating storms, scaling lifeâ€™s steep slope. Through sweat-soaked shirts and worn-out shoes, He painted his canvas with hues of daring hues.

The world scoffed, whispered tales of doubt, But he held tight to ambition, casting shadows out. From pennies in pockets to billions in vaults, His journey, a testament to relentless assaults.

 From rags to riches, he danced with fate, A phoenix rising, defying every weight. His story etched in the stars, a cosmic plan, The boy who emerged as the richest man.

 In boardrooms and ballrooms, he waltzed, A self-made symphony, notes of triumph exalted. His legacy woven into skyscrapersâ€™ steel, A saga of resilience, too grand to conceal.

 From rags to riches, he danced with fate, A phoenix rising, defying every weight. His story etched in the stars, a cosmic plan, The boy who emerged as the richest man.

 And when the moon weeps silver tears, Remember the boy who conquered fears. From povertyâ€™s grip to wealthâ€™s embrace, He became a legendâ€”a star in timeâ€™s vast space. ðŸŒŸâœ¨
